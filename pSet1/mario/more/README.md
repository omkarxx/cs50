# Mario (more) Instructions


## tl;dr
Let’s recreate those pyramids in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramids themselves are also be taller than they are wide.

```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```


## Specification
The program we’ll write will be called mario. And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.


## Usage
Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `8` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########
```

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `4` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

If the user doesn’t, in fact, input a positive integer between `1` and `8`, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate:

```
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```
