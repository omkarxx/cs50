# Caesar Instructions


## tl;dr
Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, per the below.

```
$ python caesar.py 13
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: URYYB
```


## Specification
Design and implement a program, `caesar`, that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher, exactly as you did in [Problem Set 2](../pSet2/ceasar/), except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.
- Implement your program in a file called `caesar.py` in your `~/workspace/pset6/caesar `directory (if it doesn’t already exist, create it now!).
- Your program must accept a single command-line argument, a non-negative integer. Let’s call it *k* for the sake of discussion.
- If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print an error message of your choice (with `print`) and exit immediately with a status code of 1.
- You can assume that, if a user does provide a command-line argument, it will be a non-negative integer (e.g., `1`). No need to check that it’s indeed numeric.
- Do not assume that *k* will be less than or equal to 26. Your program should work for all non-negative integral values of *k* less than 231 - 26. In other words, you don’t need to worry if your program eventually breaks if the user chooses a value for *k* that’s too big or almost too big to fit in an `int`. (Recall that an `int` can overflow.) But, even if *k* is greater than 26, alphabetical characters in your program’s input should remain alphabetical characters in your program’s output. For instance, if *k* is 27, `A` should not become `[` even though `[` is 27 positions away from `A` in ASCII, per [asciichart.com](http://www.asciichart.com/); `A` should become `B`, since `B` is 27 positions away from `A`, provided you wrap around from `Z` to `A`.
- Your program must output `plaintext`: (without a newline) and then prompt the user for a `string` of plaintext (using `get_string)`.
- Your program must output `ciphertext`: (without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext "rotated" by k positions; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
- Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters, though rotated, must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters, though rotated, must remain lowercase letters.
- After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline.


## Usage
Your program should behave per the examples below. Assume that the underlined text is what some user has typed.

```
$ python caesar.py 1
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: IFMMP
```

```
$ python caesar.py 13
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: uryyb, jbeyq
```

```
$ python caesar.py 13
plaintext:  be sure to drink your Ovaltine
ciphertext: or fher gb qevax lbhe Binygvar
```

```
$ python caesar.py
Usage: python caesar.py k
```

```
$ python caesar.py 1 2 3 4 5
Usage: python caesar.py k
```
