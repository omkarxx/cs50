# Homepage Instructions


## tl;dr
Build a simple homepage using HTML and CSS.


## Specification
Implement in your `homepage` directory a website that must:
- Contain at least four different `.html` pages, at least one of which is `index.html` (the main page of your website), and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
- Use at least ten (10) distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`. Using some tag (e.g., `<p>`) multiple times still counts as just one (1) of those ten!
- Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site. Bootstrap is a popular library (that comes with lots of CSS classes and more) via which you can beautify your site. See Bootstrapâ€™s documentation to get started. To add Bootstrap to your site, it suffices to include: `<link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">` in your pages' `<head>`, below which can `<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">` containing your own CSS.
- Have at least one stylesheet file of your own creation, `styles.css`, which uses at least five (5) different CSS selectors (e.g. tag (`example`), class (`.example`), or ID (`#example`)), and within which you use a total of at least five (5) different CSS properties, such as `font-size`, or `margin`; and
- Ensure that your site looks nice on browsers both on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.
- No need to include any JavaScript on your site for this problem set, unless so inclined!
