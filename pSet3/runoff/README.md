# Runoff Instructions


## tl;dr
Implement a program that runs a runoff election, per the below.
```
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Bob
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Charlie
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Bob

Alice
```


## Specification
Complete the implementation of `runoff.c` in such a way that it simulates a runoff election. You should complete the implementations of the `vote`, `tabulate`, `print_winner`, `find_min`, `is_tie`, and `eliminate` functions, and you should not modify anything else in `plurality.c` (and the inclusion of additional header files, if youâ€™d like).
- Complete the `vote` function:
    - The function takes arguments `voter`, `rank`, and `name`. If `name` is a match for the name of a valid candidate, then you should update the global preferences array to indicate that the voter `voter` has that candidate as their `rank` preference (where `0` is the first preference, `1` is the second preference, etc.).
    - If the preference is successfully recorded, the function should return `true`; the function should return `false` otherwise (if, for instance, `name` is not the name of one of the candidates).
    - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
- Complete the `tabulate` function:
    - The function should update the number of `votes` each candidate has at this stage in the runoff.
    - Recall that at each stage in the runoff, every voter effectively votes for their top-preferred candidate who has not already been eliminated.
- Complete the `print_winner` function:
    - If any candidate has more than half of the vote, their name should be printed to `stdout` and the function should return `true`.
    - If nobody has won the election yet, the function should return `false`.
- Complete the `find_min` function:
    - The function should return the minimum vote total for any candidate who is still in the election.
- Complete the `is_tie` function:
    - The function takes an argument `min`, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.
    - The function should return `true` if every candidate remaining in the election has the same number of votes, and should return `false` otherwise.
- Complete the `eliminate` function:
    - The function takes an argument `min`, which will be the minimum number of votes that anyone in the election currently has.
    - The function should eliminate the candidate (or candidates) who have `min` number of votes.


## Usage
Your program should behave per the example below:

```
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Charlie
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Bob

Alice
```
